Project: Cisco Packet Tracer Network Design for Office Expansion
This project involves designing and simulating a scalable, secure, and cost-effective network infrastructure for a company expanding to a new office building. The solution includes VLAN segmentation, DHCP configuration, and strategic device placement to meet departmental isolation, internet access, and future growth requirements.

Key Features:
Network Topology: Layered design with core routers, VLAN-segmented switches, and wired/Wi-Fi access points.

Budget Planning: Detailed cost breakdown for devices, cabling, and contingencies (ZAR 782,222 total).

Troubleshooting: Logged challenges (e.g., subnetting errors, Packet Tracer limitations) and solutions.

Real-World Extensions: Proposed additions like firewalls, UPS backups, and VPNs for enhanced security.

What I Learned:
Network Design: Creating VLANs, configuring DHCP, and optimizing device placement for scalability.

Collaboration: Using GitHub for version control and team coordination (conflict resolution, clear documentation).

Problem-Solving: Debugging connectivity issues and refining subnet strategies.

Project Management: Balancing technical constraints (budget, device limits) with business needs.

Tools: Cisco Packet Tracer, GitHub, VLANs, DHCP, Subnetting.
